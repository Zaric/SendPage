Troubleshoot
------------
Q: Nothing happens when I click "Send Page..."

A: For the extension to work a default mail application ("mailto:" protocol handler) must be registered on your system.


Q: The Application does not properly work with WebMail (e.g. GMail or Hotmail)

A: Make sure you enable the WebMail option in the Options of the Extension.


Q: The mail application window still doesn't open, or only at random times.

A: You can tune the close timeout in the Options of the Extension in order to give your local mail application a little more time to start.

Enjoy!
